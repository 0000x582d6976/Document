# Trying out the language

If you’d like to try One, you have a few options.

-    In your browser. You can try One right here!
-    On your computer. The One CLI project is a downloadable executable to run scripts with access to file io and more. See the One CLI docs.
-    Embedded in your code. See how to build and embed One below.
-    And then read the embedding guide!

Once you have somewhere to explore, it’s time to learn the language at [here](en/syntax).

If you run into bugs, or have ideas or questions, any of the following work:

-    Join the discord community.
-    Ask on the One mailing list (which is pretty quiet).
-    Tell us on twitter at @MaxProgram or [@OneLangTeam](https://twitter.com/OneLangTeam).
-    File a ticket at the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/One-Language/One).
-    Pull requests are welcome.
